So action B can only be executed after action A.But Action B does not have to be executed. Activity B could for instance be “Prescribe medicin”. For that to happen a medical examination has to take place, which could be activity A.The RelationCondition entity can therefore be for example 'in cases where' so 'use infusion fluid only in cases where the patient is dehydrated' or 'before' so 'before prescribing medication, perform a medical examination'.\"\"\"\n\n    span: str  # Such as: \"and finally\", \"when\", \"followed by\", \"after\", \"during this period\"\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass And(Entity):\n    \"\"\"An And entity connects two or more activities that are linked by the conjunction 'and'.
